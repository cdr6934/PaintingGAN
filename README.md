# PaintingGAN

In this assignment, we will explore the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), specifically using the CycleGAN architecture, to perform style transfer. Our task involves taking a collection of Claude Monet's paintings, learning the artistic style, and transferring this style onto other images. To achieve this, we will utilize a CycleGAN, which operates through an adversarial network to effectively learn and replicate Monet's unique style.
